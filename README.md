## SaaS Invoice Reminder & Follow-Up Automation

##### Basic Premise

Automated emails/messages to clients for a specific trigger (could be set for a date or an event). This should be made for a specific niche to be more marketable and suitable for the users needs.

##### Tech

- Cloud hosted: aws/azure
- backend: go
- UI: react? - maybe look into what could be better

##### MVP

- Usable UI - website
- Basic functionality:
	- at least 1 option for sending messages (email)
	- setting automatic messages for date/repeatable
	- set message templates that may be selected when setting the messages
- availability on cloud 

##### Future 

- mobile app
- multiple message types
- some type of response management
- add different triggers for sending
- implement client management as well? -> could trigger emails on specific set events
